A Rails-inspired Active Record for [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/).

Models with validations, callbacks, associations, and change tracking; lazy, composable queries; and a predictable save lifecycle, built for the Worker runtime and honest about what D1 can and can’t do.

> **Status: pre-release (0.x).** The API is tested against real D1, but it may still change before 1.0.

```sh
npm install @forestfuture/d1-record
```

## A quick look

A [Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) is a function that runs at Cloudflare’s edge, and [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) is its SQLite database. d1-record sits between the two: you describe each table once as a **Model**, and your Worker reads and writes **records** instead of rows.

### 1. Bind a D1 database

Create a database with [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), Cloudflare’s command-line tool, and add the snippet it prints to your Wrangler config. It gives your Worker a **binding** called `DB`:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 create my-app-db
```

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  "d1_databases": [
    { "binding": "DB", "database_name": "my-app-db", "database_id": "<the id it printed>" },
  ],
}
```

### 2. Generate your models

The generator writes each table’s migration and its Model, as `rails generate model` does (it needs Node.js 22.13 or later):

```sh
npx d1-record g model User 'email:string!:unique' 'isActive:boolean!=true'
npx d1-record g model Post user:references 'title:string!' publishedAt:datetime
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply my-app-db --local
npx d1-record console # try your Models against the local database
```

Along with the migrations, it writes `src/db/schema.ts` (every table’s columns, generated from the migrations, like Rails’ `schema.rb`) and your app’s `ApplicationRecord`.

### 3. Add behavior

A Model’s attributes come from the schema, so it declares only behavior: associations, scopes, validations, and callbacks.

```ts
// src/models/user.ts
import { hasMany } from "@forestfuture/d1-record";
import { ApplicationRecord } from "./application-record";
import { Post } from "./post";

export class User extends ApplicationRecord("users") {
  posts = hasMany(Post, { dependent: "destroy" }); // posts.user_id points here

  static active = this.scope((q) => q.where({ isActive: true }));

  static {
    this.validates("email", { presence: true, uniqueness: true });
    this.beforeSave((user) => {
      user.email = user.email.toLowerCase();
    });
  }
}
```

```ts
// src/models/post.ts
import { belongsTo } from "@forestfuture/d1-record";
import { ApplicationRecord } from "./application-record";
import { User } from "./user";

export class Post extends ApplicationRecord("posts") {
  user = belongsTo(User);
}
```

### 4. Use them in your Worker

Queries start from the Model, and use its binding during the request: there’s nothing to connect. (For a D1 Session or per-request logging, see [Connections](https://docs.forestfuture.dev/d1-record/guide/connecting).)

```ts
// src/index.ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    // GET: the 20 newest active users, each with their posts.
    if (request.method === "GET") {
      const users = await User.active()
        .includes("posts") // loaded in one extra query, not one per user
        .order({ createdAt: "desc" })
        .limit(20)
        .toArray();
      return Response.json(users);
    }

    // POST: sign up a user with a first post, saved together.
    const { email } = await request.json<{ email: string }>();
    const user = User.build({ email });
    user.posts().build({ title: "Hello, D1" });

    // save() validates and runs callbacks; false means it wasn't saved, and why is in errors.
    if (!(await user.save())) {
      return Response.json({ errors: user.errors.fullMessages() }, { status: 422 });
    }
    return Response.json(user, { status: 201 });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

### 5. Write several things at once, or not at all

D1 can’t keep a transaction open while your code awaits, so there’s no `transaction()` block. Instead, `batch([...])` sends a prepared set of writes that all succeed or all fail. `toSave()`, `toDestroy()`, and the bulk writes’ `to…` forms (`toUpdateAll`, `toDeleteAll`, …) prepare a write for the batch instead of running it:

```ts
await batch([
  Post.where({ publishedAt: null }).toUpdateAll({ publishedAt: new Date() }),
  user.toDestroy(), // and its posts, since posts are dependent: "destroy"
]);
```

## What’s in it

- **Models** whose attributes come from your migrations (`class Post extends ApplicationRecord("posts")`), typed, with Rails-style generators; or declared with `Model({...})`: camelCase attributes over snake_case columns, defaults (including app-generated keys), timestamps, JSON, and dates converted both ways.
- **Queries**: `where`/`whereNot`/`or`/`merge`, comparisons (`gte`, `between`, …), ordering (`nulls: "last"`, `reorder`), pagination (`paginate()`: a page and its total in one round trip), `select`, `distinct`, `pluck`, `count`, `size`, `exists`, named scopes, and hand-written conditions only through the `sql` tagged template, so values are always bound.
- **Persistence**: `save`/`create`/`update`/`destroy` with `…OrThrow` variants, validations (`presence`, `length`, `format`, `inclusion`, `numericality`, `uniqueness`), the full Rails callback lifecycle with `abort()`, dirty tracking (`changes`, `attributeWas`, `savedChangeTo`, …).
- **Associations**: `belongsTo`, `hasMany`, `hasOne` with scopes, `dependent:` strategies, preloading with `includes` (one query per association, never N+1), caching until reload, autosave, and `build`/`create`/`set` through the association.
- **Queries from the Model**, as in Rails: `User.find(id)`, `User.where(…)`, `User.active()`, on the Model’s binding with no setup.
- **Bulk writes**: `insert`, `insertAll`, `upsert`, `updateAll`, `deleteAll`, and `batch([...])` mixing those with records’ `toSave()`/`toDestroy()`.
- **Read replicas**: a request opened with `withDatabase(connect(env.DB, { session }), …)` sends every query through one D1 Session, so it reads its own writes; `db.bookmark()` carries that to the next request.
- **Observability**: `connect(env.DB, { onQuery })` sees every statement with its SQL, bound values, timing, and D1’s `meta`. `toSql()` shows a query’s SQL and values without sending it.

## Honest about D1

d1-record follows Rails wherever D1 allows, and says so where it can’t:

- **No interactive transactions.** D1 can’t hold a transaction open across `await`s, so there’s no `transaction(async tx => …)`. Instead, `batch([...])` writes a prepared set of statements and records atomically, and a record with `dependent: "destroy"` or new associated records is written in one batch when its keys are known in advance.
- **Keys generated in code are first-class.** A generated `TEXT` key is a UUID made at `build()` (or whatever your `generateId` makes), so records can be linked and saved together atomically before D1 has seen them.
- **D1’s limits are handled for you.** Lists of any length bind as one value (`json_each`), so the 100-bound-parameter limit never bites; preloads take one query per association.
- **Constraint errors become typed errors** (`RecordNotUnique`, `InvalidForeignKey`, `NotNullViolation`, `CheckViolation`) naming the table, columns, and attributes.
- **No request state on Model classes.** A query uses the Model’s binding, the same object for every request, or a database opened for its request with `withDatabase`, so concurrent requests on one isolate never share a Session or listener.

## Coming from Rails

Most of it will feel familiar. The main difference is naming: attributes are camelCase and map to snake_case columns (`createdAt` ↔ `created_at`), and everything names **attributes**, association keys included. Foreign keys are inferred as in Rails (`has_many :posts` on `User` uses `userId`); when you do give one, it’s `foreignKey: "userId"` where Rails writes `foreign_key: :user_id`. Column names only appear in `sql` fragments. Methods that raise end in `OrThrow` instead of `!` (`saveOrThrow` for `save!`), and predicates start with `is`/`has` instead of ending in `?` (`isNewRecord()` for `new_record?`).

## How it compares

Query builders such as [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) and [Kysely](https://kysely.dev) are SQL-first: you write queries against a typed schema, and rows come back as plain objects. d1-record is an Active Record: rows come back as records that know how to validate, save, destroy, and load their associations, with the conventions of Ruby on Rails. Its value is a coherent, rigorously tested lifecycle rather than advanced type inference. If you know Rails, you already know most of it.

## Versioning

d1-record follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). While it’s on 0.x, a breaking change bumps the minor version (0.1 → 0.2), and features and fixes bump the patch, so a `^0.1.0` range never brings in a breaking change. Every release is listed on the [releases page](https://github.com/forestfuture/d1-record/releases), and in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## For AI agents

The guide is also published for coding agents: [`llms.txt`](https://docs.forestfuture.dev/d1-record/llms.txt), [`llms-full.txt`](https://docs.forestfuture.dev/d1-record/llms-full.txt), and every page as Markdown. The package ships the guide for its own version (`node_modules/@forestfuture/d1-record/llms-full.txt`) and an [agent skill](SKILL.md) (`npx skills add forestfuture/d1-record`). See [AI agents](https://docs.forestfuture.dev/d1-record/guide/ai-agents).

## Documentation

The guide is being built in [`site/`](site/) for [docs.forestfuture.dev/d1-record](https://docs.forestfuture.dev/d1-record). Until it’s live:

- [`site/guide/`](site/guide/): the guide pages, from getting started to D1’s limits.
- [`docs/contract.md`](docs/contract.md): the full public behavior, which the tests prove.
- [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md): the domain glossary (Model, Record, Relation, Association, Batch, …).
- [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/): the architecture decisions and why they were made.

## Development

This project uses [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev) (`vp`) and pnpm. Library code runs on Workers; the tests run a real D1 through Miniflare in Node.

```sh
vp install                # install dependencies (sets up git hooks)
vp check                  # format, lint and type-check
vp test                   # unit and integration tests against a real local D1
vp pack                   # build the library into dist/
vp run check:public-types # after vp pack: the published types expose no internals
vp run test:remote        # the smoke suite against a real remote D1 (see docs/agents/remote-smoke.md)
vp run docs:dev           # the documentation site, at localhost:5173/d1-record/
```
