# Logging

Log the SQL your Worker sends to D1 with an `onQuery` listener. It’s called once for every statement, writes and batches included, with:

| Field           |                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model`         | The Model’s class name, such as `"Product"`                      |
| `sql`, `params` | The statement and its bound values                               |
| `durationMs`    | How long it took; in a batch, D1’s own timing for each statement |
| `meta`          | D1’s result metadata (rows read and written, …)                  |
| `error`         | D1’s error, when it failed                                       |

Send these wherever you like. A listener never changes a query’s outcome: one that throws is logged with `console.error`, and the query’s result stands.

Set a listener in one of two places:

|                           | Where                                                 | Knows the request? |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Every query, app-wide** | `static override onQuery` on your app’s base class    | No                 |
| **One request’s queries** | `connect(env.DB, { onQuery })`, run in `withDatabase` | Yes                |

If both are set, the request’s listener runs first, then the base class’s.

## Logging every query

Set `onQuery` on your app’s base class, in `application-record.ts`, to see every statement of every Model:

<<< @/snippets/guide/connecting.ts#app-wide{ts}

It can’t tell requests apart. A Model can set its own `static override onQuery`, which replaces the base class’s for that Model.

## Logging one request’s queries

To group a request’s queries, open its database with a listener that knows the request, and run the request inside `withDatabase`:

<<< @/snippets/guide/connecting.ts#per-request{ts}

Logged as JSON, each line can be filtered by `requestId` in [Workers Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/). Turn them on with `"observability": { "enabled": true }` in your Wrangler config.

::: warning TIP
`withDatabase` needs Node.js compatibility, which is on by default for compatibility dates from 2026-08-04. For an earlier date, add `"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"]`.
:::

## Logging only in development

Check a variable that only `.dev.vars` sets, such as `LOG_SQL=1`. For one request’s listener:

<<< @/snippets/guide/connecting.ts#development{ts}

The app-wide listener reads the variable from `cloudflare:workers` when a query runs:

<<< @/snippets/guide/connecting.ts#app-wide-development{ts}

## Timing queries in the browser

To see a request’s database time in the browser’s developer tools, add it up, and send it as a `Server-Timing` header:

<<< @/snippets/guide/connecting.ts#server-timing{ts}

## Keeping secrets out of the logs

Listeners see the values of passwords, tokens, keys, and emails as `"[FILTERED]"`, while D1 still gets the real values. [Models](./models#filtering-attributes) lists the attributes filtered by default, and everywhere their values are hidden.

### Filtering more attributes

Name them on your app’s base class, spreading in the defaults:

<<< @/snippets/guide/filtering.ts#add{ts}

A string matches any attribute whose snake_case name contains it, so `"iban"` also covers `ibanNumber`. Use a RegExp to match one name exactly.

### Seeing a filtered attribute

To see one while debugging, leave it out of the list in development:

```ts
import { Model } from "@forestfuture/d1-record";
import { schema } from "../db/schema";

export abstract class ApplicationRecord extends Model {
  static override schema = schema;
  static override filterAttributes = Model.filterAttributes.filter((entry) => entry !== "email");
}
```

### Filtering `sql` fragments

A bare value inside an `sql` fragment has no attribute, so it’s logged as given. Write a secret as `column("token").value(token)`, or compare it with a condition such as `where({ token })`, and it’s filtered. Otherwise, leave `params` out of what you log.

::: rails Compared with Rails
Rails filters by its app-wide `filter_parameters`, against parameter and column names. d1-record keeps the list on the Model (`static filterAttributes`, inherited from your base class), and matches each entry against the attribute’s snake_case name, so `"_key"` filters `apiKey`. A RegExp may match either form. It also hides filtered values in cast errors and in `RecordNotFound`, which Rails’ filter doesn’t cover.
