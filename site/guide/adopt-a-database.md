# Existing databases

d1-record reads a database’s tables from its migrations. If your database already has migrations, from Drizzle, Prisma, or Wrangler, point d1-record at them. If it doesn’t, start from a snapshot of its schema.

## Using Drizzle’s migrations

Drizzle writes its migrations to `drizzle/`, its `out` setting. Tell Wrangler where they are:

```jsonc [wrangler.jsonc]
{
  "d1_databases": [
    // Migrations as drizzle/0000_name.sql:
    { "binding": "DB", "database_name": "my-app-db", "migrations_dir": "drizzle" },
    // Or, as drizzle/<timestamp>_name/migration.sql:
    // { …, "migrations_pattern": "drizzle/*/migration.sql" },
  ],
}
```

Drizzle’s own schema often lives at `src/db/schema.ts` or in `src/db/schema/`, where d1-record writes its schema by default. Generate d1-record’s elsewhere:

```sh
npx d1-record schema --out src/db/d1-record.ts
```

If `src/models/application-record.ts` already exists, point it at the new file with `import { tables } from "../db/d1-record";`. A new one imports it already.

Pass `--out` to every later `schema` and `g` command, or keep it in a `package.json` script.

::: warning TIP
Without `--out`, d1-record refuses to write over a file it didn’t write, or beside a folder of the same name, so Drizzle’s schema is safe.
:::

## Using Prisma’s migrations

With D1, Prisma’s migrations are usually Wrangler’s own: files in `migrations/`, written by `prisma migrate diff`. `npx d1-record schema` reads them as they are.

Prisma names tables after its models, such as `User`, and columns in camelCase, such as `createdAt`. d1-record keeps both names, so the Model is `ApplicationRecord("User")`, with attributes such as `createdAt`.

::: warning Two date formats in one column
Prisma writes a `DateTime` as `2026-10-12T06:38:30.325+00:00`, and a `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` fills `2026-10-12 06:38:30`. d1-record reads both as UTC, but SQLite compares dates as text, so a column with both needs the steps in [Comparing dates in two forms](#comparing-dates-in-two-forms).
:::

## Comparing dates in two forms

A column can hold SQLite’s own date text (`2026-10-12 06:38:30`, from a `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`) beside ISO text (`2026-10-12T06:38:30.000Z`). d1-record reads both as UTC, but SQLite compares them as text. On a column with both, `order` and `between` can misplace values within a day, and a condition on one instant misses the row written in the other form.

To make the rows match, rewrite them once in a migration, with your own table and column:

<<< @/snippets/guide/mixed-dates-normalize.sql{sql}

It writes d1-record’s form for every row SQLite can read as a date, and leaves NULLs and anything else as they were. Running it again changes nothing. The rewrite is permanent, so export the table first. Conditions on the column then use its index.

If another tool still writes the other form, compare through `strftime` in a fragment instead:

<<< @/snippets/guide/mixed-dates.ts#recipe{ts}

`strftime` reads every form SQLite knows and writes d1-record’s ISO text, so rows in either form compare and sort as the times they are.

::: warning TIP
A wrapped column can’t use its index for that condition, so SQLite reads the whole table.
:::

## Starting with no migrations

For a database built by hand, or by `drizzle-kit push`, export a snapshot of its schema as the first migration, and mark it as applied:

```sh
# The tables, without their data, as a first migration:
npx wrangler d1 export my-app-db --remote --no-data --output migrations/0001_baseline.sql

# Create Wrangler's record of applied migrations, and mark the snapshot as applied,
# so Wrangler never runs it against the database it came from:
npx wrangler d1 migrations list my-app-db --remote
npx wrangler d1 execute my-app-db --remote --command "INSERT INTO d1_migrations (name) VALUES ('0001_baseline.sql')"
```

From then on, change tables with new migrations. See [Schema changes](./change-a-table).

## Checking the generated attributes

Other tools can store values differently, so a column can become the wrong attribute type without an error. When `d1-record schema` recognizes Drizzle’s or Prisma’s migrations, it prints a note for each column worth checking:

```
Note: these migrations look like Drizzle's. Some columns may convert to the wrong type without an error, especially numeric timestamps: check the generated types (…)
Note: posts.metadata: read as a string; if it holds JSON, override it as "json" in its Model
```

Fix a column’s type with an override in its Model. It changes how the column is read and written, never the table:

<<< @/snippets/guide/adopt.ts#overrides{ts}

## Reading Unix timestamps

Read a Unix timestamp column as a `Date` by overriding it as a `datetime` with the matching `storage`. Drizzle’s `integer({ mode: "timestamp" })` stores seconds, and `"timestamp_ms"` stores milliseconds:

<<< @/snippets/guide/adopt.ts#timestamps{ts}

| Drizzle mode     | `storage`            |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| `"timestamp"`    | `"unixSeconds"`      |
| `"timestamp_ms"` | `"unixMilliseconds"` |

The column stays an `INTEGER`. `createdAt` and `updatedAt` declared this way are written as integers too, and `where` and `between` take `Date`s.

Under `unixSeconds`, a `Date` is stored to the second, so a condition such as `lt(date)` compares to the second too.

::: warning A Date in an sql fragment
A `Date` beside that column in a `sql` fragment throws `TypeError`: a fragment has no attribute, so it would bind as ISO text. Use `column("publishedAt").value(date)`, which writes it as the attribute stores it. See [Writing SQL fragments](./querying#writing-sql-fragments).
:::

::: warning TIP
Prisma’s dates need no override. On D1, Prisma writes a `DateTime` as ISO text, which d1-record reads as it is.
:::

::: rails Beyond Rails
Active Record has no option for a date kept as an integer; there it takes a custom attribute type. In d1-record it’s a `storage` on the `datetime`.
