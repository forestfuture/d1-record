# Connections

A query finds its D1 database in one of three ways. Most apps only use the first.

| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The binding**            | `User.find(id)`, with nothing to set up                  | Everyday queries                                                                |
| **The request’s database** | `withDatabase(connect(env.DB, …), fn)`, once per request | Read replicas with a Session, per-request `onQuery` logging, tests, and scripts |
| **An explicit database**   | `connect(env.DB).model(User).find(id)`                   | Code that passes its database around, or uses two at once                       |

[Database resolution](./query-databases) explains why there are three, and [which one you need](./query-databases#which-do-i-need).

## Using the binding

Each Model names the D1 binding it queries, so a Model queries by itself during any request:

<<< @/snippets/guide/connecting.ts#binding{ts}

`d1-record schema` sets the binding on your app’s base class from your Wrangler config’s `d1_databases`, as `static override binding = "DB"`.

Records remember their database, so `user.save()` and `user.posts()` use the same one later. Build records with `User.build(…)`: a record made with `new User()` has no database, and throws `NoDatabase` when it needs one.

::: warning TIP
The binding is only there during a request, inside a Worker. Tests and scripts that run in Node get their database from `withDatabase`. See [Testing](./testing).
:::

## Using the request’s database

Some things belong to one request, such as a D1 Session that reads its own writes, or logging tagged with the request’s ID. Open a database for the request, and run its code inside `withDatabase`:

```ts
export default {
  fetch(request, env) {
    const db = connect(env.DB, { onQuery: log });
    return withDatabase(db, () => app.fetch(request, env));
  },
};
```

Every query started from a Model inside it, and everything it awaits, uses that database instead of the binding.

::: warning Node.js compatibility
`withDatabase` uses Workers’ `AsyncLocalStorage`. It’s on by default for compatibility dates from 2026-08-04. For an earlier date, add `"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"]` to your Wrangler config, or `withDatabase` throws `NoDatabase`. The rest of d1-record doesn’t need it.
:::

These pages use a request’s database:

- **[Read replicas](./read-your-own-writes):** a D1 Session per request.
- **[Logging](./logging):** one request’s queries, tagged with its ID.
- **[Testing](./testing):** a database for Models outside a Worker.
- **[Multiple databases](./several-databases):** `withDatabase([...])`, matched to each Model’s binding.

## Using an explicit database

Start a query from a database you hold with `db.model`. It ignores `withDatabase`:

<<< @/snippets/guide/connecting.ts#explicit{ts}

To name your Models once, use `db.models`:

<<< @/snippets/guide/connecting.ts#models{ts}

`connect(env.DB, { session, onQuery })` takes the same options as a request’s database.

## Batching writes

`batch` writes statements and records atomically, on the database they were built on:

<<< @/snippets/guide/connecting.ts#batch{ts}

Entries from a Model’s statics use the current database. `db.batch([...])` uses an explicit one. See [Bulk writes and batches](./batches).
