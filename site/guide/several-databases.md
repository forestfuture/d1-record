description: "Use two or more D1 databases from one Worker: a schema and base class for each binding, queries and writes on each, a Session for each, tests with both, and the console on one."

# Multiple databases

A Worker can bind several D1 databases. Each gets its own schema file and base class, and each Model queries the database its base class names.

## Binding the databases

Add each database to your Wrangler config, with its own `migrations_dir`:

```jsonc [wrangler.jsonc]
{
  "d1_databases": [
    { "binding": "DB", "database_name": "my-app-db", "database_id": "…" },
    {
      "binding": "LOGS",
      "database_name": "my-app-logs",
      "database_id": "…",
      "migrations_dir": "logs-migrations",
    },
  ],
}
```

Wrangler applies a folder’s migrations to one database, so each needs its own folder.

## Generating a schema for each

Generate the schemas as usual:

```sh
npx d1-record schema
```

With several databases, it writes one of each per binding:

| Binding | Schema           | Base class                                   |
| ------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `DB`    | `src/db/DB.ts`   | `DbRecord`, in `src/models/db-record.ts`     |
| `LOGS`  | `src/db/LOGS.ts` | `LogsRecord`, in `src/models/logs-record.ts` |

Each base class names its binding, so its Models query that database:

```ts
import { LogsRecord } from "./logs-record";

export class Entry extends LogsRecord("entries") {}

await Entry.where({ level: "error" }).count(); // on LOGS
```

## Generating Models for one database

Name the binding with `--database`:

```sh
npx d1-record g model Entry 'level:string!' message --database LOGS
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply my-app-logs --local
```

## Using both in a request

Query each Model as usual. Each one uses the database its base class names:

<<< @/snippets/guide/several-databases.ts#request{ts}

Records remember their database, so `user.save()` writes back to `DB`, and `entry.save()` to `LOGS`.

## Writing to both

Each write goes to one database. Write to the database that matters most first:

<<< @/snippets/guide/several-databases.ts#sign-up{ts}

If `createOrThrow` throws, nothing reaches `LOGS`.

::: warning Two databases aren’t one write
The second write can still fail after the first one succeeds. A batch can’t join them either. It writes to one database, so entries from two throw `IncompatibleRelation`.
:::

## Reading your own writes on each

With read replication, give each database its own Session. Nest a `withSession` call for each, and give each its own cookie name:

<<< @/snippets/guide/several-databases.ts#sessions{ts}

Every query in `handle` goes through the Session of its Model’s database. See [Read replicas](./read-your-own-writes) for where each Session starts.

::: warning TIP
To pass per-request options without Sessions, such as `onQuery`, open the databases yourself and pass them all to `withDatabase`:

<<< @/snippets/guide/connecting.ts#several{ts}
:::

## Testing with several databases

Outside a Worker, a Model can’t look up its binding. Give your tests the bindings by mocking `cloudflare:workers`. First, let Vitest’s mocks reach d1-record:

```ts [vitest.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: { server: { deps: { inline: ["@forestfuture/d1-record"] } } },
});
```

Then mock the module with your test databases as its `env`, using the `testDatabase` helper from [Testing](./testing):

```ts [test/worker.test.ts]
import { afterAll, beforeAll, expect, test, vi } from "vitest";
import worker from "../src/index";
import { testDatabase } from "./d1";

const env = vi.hoisted(() => ({}) as Env);
vi.mock("cloudflare:workers", () => ({ env }));

let databases: Awaited<ReturnType<typeof testDatabase>>[];
beforeAll(async () => {
  databases = await Promise.all([testDatabase(), testDatabase("logs-migrations")]);
  Object.assign(env, { DB: databases[0].binding, LOGS: databases[1].binding });
});
afterAll(() => Promise.all(databases.map((database) => database.dispose())));

test("signing in logs an entry", async () => {
  const request = new Request("https://example.com/?email=ada@example.com");
  const response = await worker.fetch(request, env);
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
});
```

Each Model now finds its own database, as it does in a Worker. Call your Worker’s `fetch` without `withDatabase`.

::: warning TIP
Assign the bindings onto the mocked `env` object, as above. d1-record reads `env` the first time a Model needs its binding, so it never sees an object assigned later.
:::

## Opening one in the console

Name the binding with `--database`:

```sh
npx d1-record console --database LOGS
```
