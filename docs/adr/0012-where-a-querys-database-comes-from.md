# Where a query's database comes from

Supersedes ADR-0003. A query finds its database one of three ways, and nothing about a request is ever stored on a Model class:

1. **The Model's binding,** with no setup, as Rails' `Product.find(id)`: `static binding = "DB"` (written on the app's base class by `d1-record schema`) names a D1 binding, read from `import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"` when a query runs. Each binding gets one Database with no Session or listener, shared by every request: the binding is the same object for all of them, so sharing it leaks nothing.
2. **The request's database:** `withDatabase(connect(env.DB, { session, onQuery }), fn)` keeps a request's Database in Workers' `AsyncLocalStorage`, which belongs to the request, and Models on its binding use it for everything `fn` awaits. This is where a D1 Session (read your own writes with replicas) and per-request `onQuery` go, and how tests and scripts outside a Worker give Models a database.
3. **An explicit database:** `db.model(X)`, `db.models({...})` and `db.batch([...])`, always on `db`.

A record keeps the database a query used to load it, or the one it was first saved or destroyed on, past the end of `withDatabase`. `batch([...])` writes on the database its entries resolve to; entries reached through a Model's statics and through `db.model(…)` of the same database share it.

ADR-0003 allowed only the explicit Database, to guarantee that no binding or Session was stored on a class where concurrent requests in one isolate could share it. That guarantee holds: level 1 stores only a binding (no request state), and level 2 stores a request's Database only in that request's `AsyncLocalStorage`. `User.using(env.DB)` stays unoffered, since it would bind a database to a class. A query listener that holds nothing about a request may live on a class, as `static onQuery` does (#78): it's shared by every request, like the binding, and can't tell them apart.

## Consequences

- **Loading the runtime's modules.** `AsyncLocalStorage` comes from `process.getBuiltinModule("node:async_hooks")`, the first time `withDatabase` is called, so Workers without Node.js compatibility still build, and only `withDatabase` needs it (a `compatibility_date` of 2026-08-04 or later, or `nodejs_compat`). `cloudflare:workers` is a literal dynamic `import()` (Wrangler and Miniflare only allow literal specifiers), loaded only when a query needs a binding; outside a Worker its absence means "not in a Worker".
- **Failures move to runtime** where the explicit form couldn't compile wrongly: a Model with no binding outside `withDatabase`, a binding missing from the Worker, or a query at a module's top level. Each throws `NoDatabase` saying what to do.
- **Identity lives in the `Executor` module (#93).** "Is this the same database?" is answered in one place, `oneDatabase`, by the databases handles resolve to: when the query runs for merge, or and scopes, and before anything runs for batches, saves and destroys, whose records (a save's autosave graph) all keep the database it found. Before, callers compared executor objects, which refused a loaded record's association merged with a static, and left autosaved records on the current database.
- **Verified in workerd** (tests/integration/workerd-platform.test.ts): `env.DB` from `cloudflare:workers` is the handler's own object, so a request's database matches its Models by binding.
