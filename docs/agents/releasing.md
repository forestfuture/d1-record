# Releasing

Versions and the changelog are managed with [Changesets](https://changesets.dev), and CI publishes to npm. Nothing is published by an ordinary commit to `main`: the **Version Packages** pull request is the gate.

## Day to day: add a changeset

Every user-visible change (new behavior, a fix, a breaking change, a deprecation) comes with a changeset, committed with the change:

```sh
vp exec changeset
```

Or write the file by hand in `.changeset/` (any name ending in `.md`):

```md
---
"@forestfuture/d1-record": patch
---

`findBy` accepts a comparison, as `where` does.
```

The line is for the library's users: say what changed for them, not how. Internal changes (tests, refactors, docs for contributors, CI) need no changeset.

**Which bump, while on 0.x:** a breaking change is `minor` (0.1.x → 0.2.0), and a feature or a fix is `patch`. `major` is for 1.0. npm's `^0.1.0` ranges never take a new minor, so users only get breaking changes when they choose to.

## What CI does

The release jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` run on `main`, after `check` passes, one run at a time:

1. **`release-mode`** works out what to do:
   - `version` while changesets are waiting;
   - `publish` once `package.json` has a version npm doesn't have yet;
   - `none` otherwise, which is what most pushes hit.
2. **`release-version`** opens or updates the **Version Packages** pull request. That pull request bumps `package.json`, writes `CHANGELOG.md` (formatted with `vp fmt`) and deletes the used changesets. CI rewrites its branch on every push to `main`, so don't edit it by hand. Pull requests opened by Actions don't run CI, but merging one runs CI on `main` before anything is published.
3. **`release-pack`** packs the tarball. Packing runs the package's `prepack` script, which builds `dist/` with `vp pack` (attw and publint included), then the docs site, and copies its `llms-full.txt` into the package. So a docs build that fails, a dead link included, blocks the release.
4. **`release-publish`** publishes the tarball to npm with provenance, tags the commit with the version, and creates a GitHub Release with its changelog. It's the only job that can get an OIDC token (`id-token: write`). Changesets publishes with pnpm, so provenance is turned on with `PNPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE`: pnpm ignores `NPM_CONFIG_*`.

To release, merge the Version Packages pull request.

## One-time setup

These are done once, in this order.

1. **Allow Actions to open pull requests.** In the `forestfuture` organization's settings, then in the repository's: Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**. Both have to allow it.
2. **Make the repository public.** npm only attaches provenance to packages published from a public repository.
3. **Edit anything that says the package isn't published yet**, in a pull request to `main`: the "Not on npm yet" warning in `site/guide/getting-started.md`.
4. **The first release used a temporary token**, because npm only lets a trusted publisher be set on a package that already exists. `0.1.0` went out this way on 2026-10-10: a granular access token named `d1-record first release` (Read and write for the `@forestfuture` scope, the shortest expiry, "Bypass two-factor authentication" ticked), stored with `gh secret set NPM_TOKEN`, and written to `~/.npmrc` by a step in `release-publish` that has since been removed. If a publish fails because pnpm tried trusted publishing first (an OIDC or token-exchange error), nothing was published: delete the tag and release if they were created, then re-run the failed `release-publish` job.
5. **Then switch to trusted publishing:**
   1. On npmjs.com, the package's Settings → **Trusted Publisher** → GitHub Actions: organization `forestfuture`, repository `d1-record`, workflow `ci.yml`, no environment.
      Allow **publish**, not only staged publish: with only `stage publish`, a publish fails with `403 Forbidden: OIDC permission denied for this action`. From a terminal outside the repo (npm refuses to run inside it, because of `devEngines`), `npm trust list @forestfuture/d1-record` shows the entry, and `npm trust github @forestfuture/d1-record --file ci.yml --repo forestfuture/d1-record --allow-publish` creates one.
   2. Delete the secret (`gh secret delete NPM_TOKEN`) and the token on npmjs.com.
   3. In the package's Settings → Publishing access, choose **Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens**.
   4. In the `forestfuture` organization's settings, require 2FA for members.
6. **Check each release for provenance.** The package page on npmjs.com shows a provenance badge linking to the commit, and the version has `dist.attestations`. `0.1.0` has none (#109), because a token published it. `0.1.1` was the first published through the trusted publisher, and has one (2026-10-10). The registry can take a few minutes to list a version just published: a 404 straight after a green `release-publish` is that lag, and `npm view @forestfuture/d1-record@<version> --prefer-online` settles it.

From then on, only CI in `forestfuture/d1-record`, from `ci.yml`, can publish.

## After the first release: help agents find it

1. **Install the skill once** to check it works for others: `npx skills add forestfuture/d1-record`. skills.sh has no submission and no crawler: a skill is listed from the install counts that the skills CLI reports for public GitHub repositories. Look for `d1-record` at https://www.skills.sh a day or two later.
2. **Topics (https://www.skills.sh/topic/databases) have no documented request process.** The Databases topic lists vendors' skills. If `d1-record` isn't under a topic it fits, open a Feature request on `vercel-labs/skills` asking how topics are assigned. Don't send a "listing" request: the install already created the listing.
3. **Add the docs to Context7** (https://context7.com) at https://context7.com/add-library, on the GitHub tab, with `https://github.com/forestfuture/d1-record`. Anyone can add a public library. Its Context7 ID is `/forestfuture/d1-record`, and it's claimed: `context7.json` in the repository root holds the claim (`url` and `public_key`, from the claim modal on Context7, which must match exactly) and Context7's settings (title, description, the folders and files indexed, and rules for agents). Context7 refreshes by itself, and the claim's admin panel can refresh it.
   - **A known limit:** the guide pages include their larger examples from `site/snippets/`, and Context7 indexes Markdown, not `.ts`, so its GitHub index shows those pages without the example code. The `llms-full.txt` the site builds has them expanded.
